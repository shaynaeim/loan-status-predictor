# A deep learning model for predicting loan repayment risk using the LendingClub dataset.

This project uses the Keras API to build and train a binary classification model that predicts whether a borrower will repay or default on a loan. The dataset comes from LendingClub, a peer-to-peer lending platform, and includes borrower information such as income, credit history, and loan purpose.
